# Smart Home Automation

Welcome to **Smart Home Automation**! This project aims to bring advanced automation capabilities to your home using C++. With it, you can control, monitor, and automate various devices and sensors, improving comfort, energy efficiency, and security.

## Features

- Device control and monitoring through sensors and actuators
- Automation routines for lights, climate, security, and more
- Modular codebase for easy extension
- Real-time feedback and status updates
- Integrates with common smart home hardware

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), if targeting microcontrollers

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anubhavb4123/Smart_Home_Automation.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your preferred IDE.

3. Build and upload the code to your hardware.

### Usage

Configure the main source files according to your hardware (pins, sensors, relays, etc.). Run the compiled binary (for desktop/testing) or upload to your microcontroller/board for in-home use.
